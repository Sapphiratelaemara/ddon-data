Nearby there was\r\neven a door that led the upper floor of\r\nthe castle.\r\n It was then that Prince Ned requested us\r\nto track down and rescue the people who\r\ndisappeared when the enemy took over Lookout\r\nCastle.\r\n In order to successfully distract the enemy at\r\nthe Wailing Wetland we must use all our might\r\nto lure them in. It is a reckless strategy I\r\nmust admit.\r\n No, when we retake the castle we will be able\r\nto save so many people. If we abandon them then\r\nthe Liberation Army will lose their last bit\r\nof hope. That is how determined he must be.\r\n Anyways, we should not take our eyes off of\r\nPrince Ned from here on.",
