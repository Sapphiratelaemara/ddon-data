This means that if the\r\narisen can defeat the Wicked Dragon,\r\nthan Acre Selund can still keep its\r\nDragon and Dragon Force.\r\nã€€If we enact the plan passed down through\r\nthe Acre royal family, then inheriting the\r\nDragon Force should be possible. This is\r\none matter that has finally been settled.\r\n Now, in order to defeat the Wicked Dragon,\r\nthe Liberation Army and the arisen are\r\nworking on taking back Lookout Castle.\r\nCurrently they are drawing out the orcs\r\noccupying the castle outside of the castle\r\nwalls.\r\n Diversionary tactics are effective on\r\norcs. If we can take back the castle that\r\nwas once a symbol of the majesty of the\r\nroyal family, it should have a positive\r\naffect on the morale of the people.\r\n I hope for a good outcome from the battle,\r\nfor the sake of the castle and the plan.",
