In order to find him\r\nwe will need to negotiate with them,\r\nhowever it may prove difficult as there\r\nis some animosity between the bandits\r\nand the royal family.\r\n In order to bolster the Liberation Army's\r\nforces we sought cooperation from a man\r\nnamed Gerhard, however he refused to listen\r\ndue to the prince's absence.\r\n General Meirova, the bandits, and even\r\nGerhard must not be shortsighted, and\r\nshould look towards the future. This is,\r\nhowever, easier said than done.",
