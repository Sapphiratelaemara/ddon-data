    "Message" : "　Similar to the events concerning the new\r\ndragon in Phindym, a phenomenon occured in\r\nthe sky. What suddenly came falling out of the\r\nsky was not rain but crimson fire. Flames\r\nscorched the land, and the populace fled.\r\n　Next, the temple was attacked. A massive\r\neyeball was floating in the sky, and its voice\r\nrang throughout the temple. The Eye mocked\r\nthe White Dragon. My legs were frozen, and I\r\ncould not even let out a scream.\r\n　The Arisens began to move immediately. As\r\nexpected, I must say. However, four elite Arisen\r\nwere abducted, leaving no trace.\r\n　Lestania had restored peace, but with the\r\nvanished Arisen's location unknown, we could\r\ndo nothing through the night.\r\n　They eventually returned safely, however I\r\ncouldn't supress my shock and fear from their\r\nreport. The Arisen were brought to a land the\r\npeople called Acre Selund.\r\n　Acre Selund is a land covered in war and\r\ndespair, the people are in constant struggle\r\nwith the \"Evil Dragon\". Further notes recquire\r\nadditional inspection of the Arisens story.\r\nI'll write more at a later time.",
