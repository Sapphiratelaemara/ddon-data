There were reports that\r\nthe rivers were stagnating, and giving\r\noff a horrendous stench.\r\n The Knights realized that the blood orbs\r\nwere only having a slight effect. There was\r\nnothing else left but hope for the arisens\r\nsuccess.\r\n And so the arisen did succeed. With the\r\nwonderful aid from the Liberation Army,\r\nthey managed to defeat the Black Knight\r\nand brought back his sword. The White Dragon\r\nregained his Dragon Force and his vitality.\r\n I still have many questions regarding the\r\nBlack Knight, however right now I merely\r\nwish to rejoice in the White Dragon's recovery.\r\nThe White Dragon said that a dragon can\r\nnot live by oneself. The relation between\r\ndragon and human is a strange one. Everyone\r\nreflected on his words.",
