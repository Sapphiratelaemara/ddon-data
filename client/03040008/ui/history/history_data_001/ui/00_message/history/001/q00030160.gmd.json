Was there no\r\nway we could have prevented this tragedy?\r\n I will record exactly what has transpired.\r\nThe Liberation Army, the soldiers from\r\nMegado, and the Norther Bandit's diversionary\r\ntactics ended in a success and they scattered\r\ninto the capital. The orcs were in chaos,\r\nand they managed to infiltrate inside.\r\n At that time, the White Dragon temple fell\r\nin an instant. I then heard the sound of\r\narmor clanking. Finally, he appeared, and I\r\nrealized it was a trap.\r\n The Black Knight arrived, and pierced the\r\nWhite Dragon with his sword, gravely\r\nwounding him. He ignored the arisen's\r\nretalitation, and calmly disappeared.\r\n Look at the people seeking answers from\r\nthe White Dragon. The White Dragon nor I\r\nknow how to answer their concerns.",
