Furthermore everyone\r\nrecognized the exploits of our own Arisen.\r\nI am honored by the Arisen acting as our\r\nrepresentative fighting in a distant land.\r\n However, there is a problem involving the\r\nsuccession of the Fire Dragon's power. Even\r\nif Ned is an arisen, the dragon is the one\r\nthat must enact the succession. As long as\r\nthe Wicked Dragon continues his invasion,\r\nit is difficult to see a solution to this\r\nproblem.\r\n We must gather more information regarding\r\nAcre Selund before solving this problem or\r\nthe question of why the Wicked Dragon brought\r\nour Arisen here.",
