He offered himself\r\nas a hostage so that his comrades could return.\r\n That Arisens name was Elliot. I am honoring\r\nhis dedication in these logs. Naturally, we \r\nwould never abandon him, he has been safely\r\nreunited with his comrades.\r\n　Back to the matter of Acre Selund. It was\r\noriginally the Fire Dragon's continent, until\r\nthe Black Dragon appeared and attacked the\r\nFire Dragon. The Fire Dragon was defeated and\r\nthe Wicked Dragon took control of the land.\r\n　The Wicked Dragon took control of the Orcs of\r\nAcre Selund and begin to conquer the human's\r\nterritory. The humans fought back, however they\r\nwere no match against the combined forces of\r\nthe orcs and a dragon.\r\nThose who lost the will to fight abandoned the\r\nmilitary, and now those that call themselves\r\nthe Liberation Army are continuing to fight\r\na losing battle.\r\n　Now, what path should we choose? We still\r\ndon't even know how many paths there are.",
