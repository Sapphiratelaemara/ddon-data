If that is true, then the prince\r\nshould be the next Fire Dragon.\r\n General Meirova believes adding the\r\nprince to the Liberation Army will\r\nrekindle the dwindling hope in the people.\r\n Naturally I want to believe too, but I\r\nam a bit unsure. Did the previous Fire\r\nDragon actually make Prince Ned an Arisen?",
