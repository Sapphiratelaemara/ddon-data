The arisen are currently\r\nheading towards the fight that will decide\r\nLestania's fate. All I can do is pray for\r\ntheir success.\r\n Some good news arrived from a messanger\r\nfrom Phindym. I must admit hearing news\r\nthat the Spirit Dragon who had been in\r\na deep slumber showed signs of awakening\r\nfrustrated me. It was slight, but it was\r\nthe truth.\r\n However there were those that thought that\r\nthe timing was not a coincidence. I trusted\r\nin their judgement and sent the arisen\r\nfamiliar with her.\r\n The arisen say they saw Mysial. Was the \r\nMysial I saw when the White Dragon was\r\nattacked not a phantom as well?\r\n The Spirit Dragon Cecily has still not\r\nawakened. She used what power she had to\r\ninform us of a way to save the White Dragon.\r\nI have no idea how to possibly thank her\r\nfor this.",
