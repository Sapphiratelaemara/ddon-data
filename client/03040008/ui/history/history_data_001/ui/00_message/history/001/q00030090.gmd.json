We\r\nwill have to confirm whether Prince Ned\r\ncan inherit the Dragon Force later.\r\n The enemy learned that Prince Ned has\r\nrendezvoused with the Liberation Army.\r\nThe Wicked Dragon's counterattack has\r\ngrown violent. The Liberation Army is\r\ncurrently being pursued. I have high\r\nexpectations for our arisen.\r\n Thankfully, our arisen have grown\r\naccustomed to fighting orcs. Even if\r\nthe land changes, orcs never change.\r\nAs long as they fight together with the\r\nLiberation Army, the orcs should not be\r\na threat.\r\n The problem is the strange weapons and\r\nbeasts that appear in Acre Selund, however\r\nour elite arisen superbly dealt with them.\r\n They saved Prince Ned fighting on the\r\nfront lines, furthering the faith people\r\nhave in them.\r\n However, we must not forget the Wicked\r\nDragon is the one that brought them to\r\nAcre Selund. As long as these questions\r\nremain, it is difficult to be excited\r\nover one victory.",
