I applaud their\r\nwondrous deeds.\r\n Prince Ned's reckless actions could have\r\nbeen from a childish sentimentality, however\r\nI would rather believe it was wanting to\r\nprotect something, even if it costed him\r\nhis life. We must protect the new Fire Dragon,\r\nPrince Ned's, honor from here on.\r\n Now, the reason the Wicked Dragon called\r\nthe arisen to Acre Selund was to show them a\r\nworld that had submitted to his ultimate\r\npower.\r\n The Black Knight was merely using him, his\r\ngoal was to have the Wicked Dragon be a symbol\r\nof power.\r\n Even the all power Wicked Dragon was a sad\r\nmonster being controlled. Our true enemy is the\r\none behind the Wicked Dragon and the Black Knight.\r\n I can faintly see who they truly are, but I\r\nshall leave it for a later day. For now, I just\r\nwant to enjoy the end of the war.",
