This time I recieved word of who that\r\nsupport was.\r\n They were a single knight, clad in black\r\narmor, utilizing their strong leadership\r\nand swordsmanship to make quick work of\r\nthe city's guards.\r\n A knight clad in black armor, It reminds\r\nme of the dreaded knight that stole the\r\ncommander of our arisen away.\r\n I whole-heartedly believe the Black Knight\r\nis dead, however certainly I am not the only\r\none concerned by this news.",
