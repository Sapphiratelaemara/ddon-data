    "Message" : " Prince Ned turned out to be more influential\r\nthan I had anticpated. Previously, Gerhard\r\nhad refused his cooperation, however now with\r\nthe Prince's help he pledged his full support.\r\n Gerhard was cautious, only pledging his\r\nallegiance after it was confirmed wheter or\r\nnot the Prince was truly and arisen. He would\r\nbe a formidable foe, but as a friend he is\r\nincredibly reliable. The words of a man who\r\nalways has the trust of the people is\r\nreassuring.\r\n However the worry I wrote in my previous\r\nremains. Even if Prince Ned is a true arisen,\r\nthe one who made him an arisen was the Fire\r\nDragon. We need to confirm whether or not\r\nhe can inherit the Wicked Dragon's Dragon \r\nForce. Now that I think about it, it seems\r\nso obvious.\r\n In order to confirm it, Prince Ned needs to\r\ncome in contact with the Wicked Dragon. This\r\nwill allow our arisen, acting as his bodyguards,\r\nto get close to the Wicked Dragon as well.",
