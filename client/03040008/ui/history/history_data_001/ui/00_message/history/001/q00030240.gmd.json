They established a\r\nbase at the entrance to the mountain and\r\nreturned here to prepare.\r\n There is something that concerns me\r\nabout the prince running off by himself.\r\n The members of the Liberation Army intend\r\nto respect the princes feelings. Could\r\nthat be an advantage for the Wicked Dragon?\r\n To the Liberation Army, Prince Ned is\r\ntheir master. It is difficult for vassals\r\nto reject their master's words or actions.\r\nMeirova is an old fashioned man, he may\r\nthink the prince sacrificing himself as\r\nvirtuous.\r\n Of course, I can't accept his behavior.\r\nHere in Lestania it would not have any\r\npossitive effect.\r\n I told the arisen to prioritize defeating\r\nWicked Dragon. They should be able to\r\nunderstand my true meaning. There are\r\nsome things only an outsider can do.",
