I\r\ninformed the person handling him.\r\n The arisen searched for the Ring of\r\nSamara in Acre Selund, and have finally\r\nacquired it. It has the power to open the\r\nsealed gate it seems. This is another\r\nstep forward.\r\n However I hear the path set before them\r\nis rigorous. I can only pray for safety\r\nof the arisen.\r\n Much like the Ring of Samara, there are\r\nmany objects here in Lestania with\r\nunexpected effects. I am considering having\r\nthem gathered and kept here in the temple.\r\nWe must prevent these relics from being\r\nlost to time. What is happening in Acre\r\nSelund could happen here as well. We must\r\nlearn this lesson well.",
