He said he\r\nenjoyed watching Acre Selund crumble\r\nat the might of his power.\r\n The Wicked Dragon has no doubt in his\r\nsuperiority or victory, even the counter\r\nattack against the Liberation Army is just\r\nanother step towards the destruict of Acre\r\nSelund.\r\n What an arrogant thing to say. I can only\r\nthink he is trying to display his power to\r\nthe arisen, so that the White Dragon may\r\nhear of it.\r\n This is a warning. First Acre Selund, next\r\nLestania. The Wicked Dragon is threatening\r\nus.\r\n The question regarding the Dragon Force\r\ndisappeared from the minds of Prince Ned\r\nand the Liberation Army. All that was left\r\nwas to pursue the Wicked Dragon.\r\n We must not waver, no matter what the\r\nWicked Dragon says. There are many that\r\nbelieve in the White Dragon, no matter\r\nwhat the Wicked Dragon attempts to do.",
