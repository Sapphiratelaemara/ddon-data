Based on a set of conversion rules I will provide please replace the C++ field definitions with Java method invocations:

Here are the conversion rules:
Replace lines starting with "bool" with "fileReader.readBoolean(),"
Replace lines starting with "u16" with "fileReader.readUnsignedShort(),"
Replace lines starting with "u32" with "fileReader.readUnsignedInteger(),"
Replace lines starting with "s32" with "fileReader.readSignedInteger(),"
Replace lines starting with "u64" with "fileReader.readUnsignedLong(),"
Replace lines starting with "f32" with "fileReader.readFloat(),"
If the line additionally ends on an array definition with a size, replace instead with "fileReader.readFixedLengthArray(<arraysize>, FileReader::<method>)" where <arraysize is the identified size and <method> is the previously identified method replacement
Replace lines starting with "c" followed by some string string with "fileReader.readArray(fileReader.read<entityname>())," where <entityname> is the previously identified string

Here are the C++ field definitions:
