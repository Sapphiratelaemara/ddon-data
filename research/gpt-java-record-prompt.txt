Based on a set of conversion rules I will provide you and your own knowledge about programming languages please convert the C++ structs I will provide to one or more Java records.

Here are the conversion rules:
1. Remove the initial "m" prefix from field names.
2. Use PascalCase for field names.
3. Don't change the field order.
4. Map arrays to Java Lists.
5. Map char[] arrays to Strings.
6. Map s32 to int.
7. Map u32 to long.
8. Map u16 to int.
9. Map u64 to BigInteger.
10. Ignore comments.
11. Map MtVector3 to Vector3f.

Here are the C++ structs:
